GDScript is a high level, dynamically typed programming language used to create content. It uses a syntax similar to Python (blocks are indent-based and many keywords are similar). Its goal is to be optimized for and tightly integrated with Godot Engine, allowing great flexibility for content creation and integration.
      </p>

      <p>
     In the following, an overview is given to GDScript. Details, such as which methods are available to arrays or other objects, should be looked up in the linked class descriptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the fundamental benefits of exporting member variables is to have them visible and editable in the editor. This way, artists and game designers can modify values that later influence how the program runs. For this, a special export syntax is provided.

    <header>History</header>
    <article>
     In the early days, the engine used the Lua scripting language. Lua is fast, but creating bindings to an object oriented system (by using fallbacks) was complex and slow and took an enormous amount of code. After some experiments with Python, it also proved difficult to embed.

The last third party scripting language that was used for shipped games was Squirrel, but it was dropped as well. At that point, it became evident that a custom scripting language could more optimally make use of Godot’s particular architecture:

Godot embeds scripts in nodes. Most languages are not designed with this in mind.
Godot uses several built-in data types for 2D and 3D math. Script languages do not provide this, and binding them is inefficient.
Godot uses threads heavily for lifting and initializing data from the net or disk. Script interpreters for common languages are not friendly to this.
Godot already has a memory management model for resources, most script languages provide their own, which results in duplicate effort and bugs.
Binding code is always messy and results in several failure points, unexpected bugs and generally low maintainability.
The result of these considerations is GDScript. The language and interpreter for GDScript ended up being smaller than the binding code itself for Lua and Squirrel, while having equal functionality. With time, having a built-in language has proven to be a huge advantage.

    <p>
     Any string that restricts itself to alphabetic characters (a to z and A to Z), digits (0 to 9) and _ qualifies as an identifier.
    </p>
    <p>
     Additionally, identifiers must not begin with a digit. Identifiers are case-sensitive (foo is different from FOO).
    </p>
    <p>
     $ sign is use to connect or declare a sprite or animated sprite.

     <p>Some people can learn better by taking a look at the syntax, so here’s a simple example of how GDScript looks.
      <code># A file is a class!

class_name MyClass, "res://path/to/optional/icon.svg"

# Member Variables

var a = 5
var s = "Hello"
var arr = [1, 2, 3]
var dict = {"key": "value", 2:3}
var typed_var: int
var inferred_type := "String"

# Constants

const ANSWER = 42
const THE_NAME = "Charly"

# Enums

enum {UNIT_NEUTRAL, UNIT_ENEMY, UNIT_ALLY}
enum Named {THING_1, THING_2, ANOTHER_THING = -1}

# Built-in Vector Types

var v2 = Vector2(1, 2)
var v3 = Vector3(1, 2, 3)

# Function

func some_function(param1, param2):
    var local_var = 5

    if param1 < local_var:
        print(param1)
    elif param2 > 5:
        print(param2)
    else:
        print("Fail!")

    for i in range(20):
        print(i)

    while param2 != 0:
        param2 -= 1

    var local_var2 = param1 + 3
    return local_var2

# Functions override functions with the same name on the base/parent class.
# If you still want to call them, use '.' (like 'super' in other languages).

func something(p1, p2):
    .something(p1, p2)

# Inner Class

class Something:
    var a = 10

# Constructor

func _init():
    print("Constructed!")
    var lv = Something.new()
    print(lv.a)</code></p>

    <article>
      <p>The following is the list of keywords supported by the language. Since keywords are reserved words (tokens), they can’t be used as identifiers. Operators (like in, not, and or or) and names of built-in types as listed in the following sections are also reserved.
      </p>

      <p>
       Keywords are defined in the GDScript tokenizer in case you want to take a look under the hood.

    <article>
     <p>Built-in types are stack-allocated. They are passed as values. This means a copy is created on each assignment or when passing them as arguments to functions. The only exceptions are Arrays and Dictionaries, which are passed by reference so they are shared. (Not PoolArrays like PoolByteArray though, those are passed as values too, so consider this when deciding which to use!)</p>
      <code>Basic built-in types
A variable in GDScript can be assigned to several built-in types.

null
null is an empty data type that contains no information and can not be assigned any other value.

bool
The Boolean data type can only contain true or false.

int
The integer data type can only contain integer numbers, (both negative and positive).

float
Used to contain a floating point value (real numbers).

String
A sequence of characters in Unicode format. Strings can contain the standard C escape sequences. GDScript supports format strings aka printf functionality.

Vector built-in types
Vector2
2D vector type containing x and y fields. Can also be accessed as array.

Rect2
2D Rectangle type containing two vectors fields: position and size. Alternatively contains an end field which is position+size.

Vector3
3D vector type containing x, y and z fields. This can also be accessed as an array.

Transform2D
3x2 matrix used for 2D transforms.

Plane
3D Plane type in normalized form that contains a normal vector field and a d scalar distance.

Quat
Quaternion is a datatype used for representing a 3D rotation. It’s useful for interpolating rotations.

AABB
Axis-aligned bounding box (or 3D box) contains 2 vectors fields: position and size. Alternatively contains an end field which is position+size.

Basis
3x3 matrix used for 3D rotation and scale. It contains 3 vector fields (x, y and z) and can also be accessed as an array of 3D vectors.

Transform
3D Transform contains a Basis field basis and a Vector3 field origin.

Engine built-in types
Color
Color data type contains r, g, b, and a fields. It can also be accessed as h, s, and v for hue/saturation/value.

NodePath
Compiled path to a node used mainly in the scene system. It can be easily assigned to, and from, a String.

RID
Resource ID (RID). Servers use generic RIDs to reference opaque data.

Object
Base class for anything that is not a built-in type.</code>

  <section class="main-section" id="constant">
    <header>constant</header>
    <article>
     Constants are similar to variables, but must be constants or constant expressions and must be assigned on initialization.
      <code>const A = 5
const B = Vector2(20, 20)
const C = 10 + 20 # Constant expression.
const D = Vector2(20, 30).x # Constant expression: 20
const E = [1, 2, 3, 4][0] # Constant expression: 1
const F = sin(20) # sin() can be used in constant expressions.
const G = x + 20 # Invalid; this is not a constant expression!
const H = A + 20 # Constant expression: 25</code>
      <p>Although the type of constants is inferred from the assigned value, it’s also possible to add explicit type specification:</p>
      <code>const A: int = 5
const B: Vector2 = Vector2()</code>
      <p>Assigning a value of an incompatible type will raise an error.</p>
    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="variables">
    <header>variables</header>
    <article>
     <p>Variables can exist as class members or local to functions. They are created with the var keyword and may, optionally, be assigned a value upon initialization.</p>
      <code>var a # Data type is 'null' by default.
var b = 5
var c = 3.8
var d = b + c # Variables are always initialized in order.</code>
           <p>Variables can optionally have a type specification. When a type is specified, the variable will be forced to have always that same type, and trying to assign an incompatible value will raise an error.

Types are specified in the variable declaration using a : (colon) symbol after the variable name, followed by the type.</p>

      <code>var my_vector2: Vector2
var my_node: Node = Sprite.new()</code>
      <p>If the variable is initialized within the declaration, the type can be inferred, so it’s possible to omit the type name:</p>
      <code>var my_vector2 :=  Vector2() # 'my_vector2' is of type 'Vector2'
var my_node := Sprite.new() # 'my_node' is of type 'Sprite'</code>
      <p>Type inference is only possible if the assigned value has a defined type, otherwise it will raise an error.

Valid types are:

Built-in types (Array, Vector2, int, String, etc.)
Engine classes (Node, Resource, Reference, etc.)
Constant names if they contain a script resource (MyScript if you declared const MyScript = preload("res://my_script.gd")).
Other classes in the same script, respecting scope (InnerClass.NestedClass if you declared class NestedClass inside the class InnerClass in the same scope)
Script classes declared with the class_name keyword.</p>
